# Keypop Card Java API

## Overview

This repository contains a Java implementation aligned with the **Terminal Card** specifications 
proposed by the [Calypso Networks Association](https://www.calypsonet.org). It is the link between the layer dedicated 
to the functional processing of cards and the layer of communication with the card readers. It defines the interfaces 
needed to communicate with the cards and manage the selection mechanisms.
